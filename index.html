  <p>
    An “About Me,” also known as a blurb, is a short piece of writing that informs your reader about your professional background, key accomplishments, personal values and any brands you may be associated with. Personal websites, social media profiles and company directories often feature “About Me” sections.
    An ’About Me’ page is one of the most important parts of your portfolio, website, or blog. This page is where prospective employers, potential clients, website users, and other professional and personal connections go to learn about who you are and what you do. And it's an ideal resource for promoting your professional brand.

    It can be challenging to write about yourself. However, the good news is if you follow the formula and tips below, you should be able to generate an engaging ‘About Me’ statement without too much of a struggle.
    
    Here’s how to write an ‘About Me’ page you can be proud of.
    
    Why Create an 'About Me' Page
    Should you or shouldn't you put the effort into crafting your perfect 'About Me' page? Here are a few reasons why you should (and maybe shouldn't) spend the time.
    
    Why?
    It's an ideal way to promote your professional brand and yourself as an authority.
    
    
    
    Potential clients, employers, and others can go to your 'About Me' page to learn more about you.
    
    
    
    Why Not?
    Could lose traffic if your 'About Me' page is focused too much on you and not on what you can offer your reader.
    
    
    
    Can turn people away if you don't respond quickly to comments or contact requests.
    
    
    
    Getting Started: Step-By-Step Guide
    Your ‘About Me’ page should convey:
    Who you are and what you’re doing
    How you got there
    Where you’re looking to go next
    Use this space to describe your credentials, expertise, and goals. What’s the best way to start? The following exercises can be helpful in figuring all of that out, and will help you determine what to include based on your target audience.
    
    Spend about five minutes on each question. You can use the example answers to give you an idea of what that answer might sound like in its final form, but be sure to use your own words.
